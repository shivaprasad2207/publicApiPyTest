1. Where would you start? What would be your first steps?  

The testing team should start from very beginning of the development process.
When all the requirements are from user (customers) are written. 
Testing team should work in co-ordination with development team and work together
during the every stage of development. Testing team should know first deliverable milestones,
development cycle, method and process of development team, so that testing team prioritize its activities, like,   

- Test plan, test cases and test procedures.   
- Ready with Regression automation bundle. 
- Ready with machine setup required. 
- Defect rising, reporting  and  tracking channels.

2. Which process would you establish around testing new functionality? How would you want the features to be tested? 
   For any new feature sprint testing is used, where in all the functionality and sub-functionality of feature tested.
   Since the code for the new feature is recently added more testing has to be done as much as. This include manual testing with
   different cross platform testing. As new code is added, the backward comaptibility of all exisitng functionality to be tested
   so that they are not affected due new code addtion. As exisitng functionality test might have done earlier cycle,
   here we should depend upon reliable test automation.

3. If you would do test automation which techniques or best practices would you use?
